Tilbury, fresh off a flight from London, sat with Hanlon to get her fringe trimmed while they waiting for the models.</p>\n\n<p>\"Prabal brings you on such an amazing journey with his inspiration,\" said Tilbury, who has done the makeup for Gurung's shows for the last few seasons. \"He wanted these girls to be confident and empowered, with ruddy cheeks as if they have been out in the elements.\" </p>\n\n<p>Hanlon, who creates some of the most wearable hair for the runway interpreted this strong woman as one on the go. \"The hair is a bit savage and pulled back, as if she had been out running,\" he said. \"I used my hands and just knotted it. I pulled pieces back to get that texture.\"</p>\n\n<p>The team worked late into the night (midnight to be exact) to do the finishing touches on the collection. Black, red, gold, and army green dominated the palette with bits of white and blue sprinkled in. This season's thigh-high laced boots and fur collars secured with leather harnesses topped skinny pants and peplum jackets. The final look was every bit the empowered female Gurung was aiming for. </p>\n<!-- Start of Brightcove Player -->\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">\n\n</div>\n\n<!--\nBy use of this code snippet, I agree to the Brightcove Publisher T and C \nfound at https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/. \n-->\n\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"></script>\n\n<object id=\"myExperience2153891852001\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n  <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n  <param name=\"width\" value=\"480\" />\n  <param name=\"height\" value=\"270\" />\n  <param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1697316507001\" />\n  <param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAAABYxIBg~,iuV76rCkkDDhCm16wBI3cvDgs1AB1eVh\" />\n  <param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n  <param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n  <param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" />\n  \n  <param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"2153891852001\" />\n</object>\n\n<!-- \nThis script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon\nas the line is read by the browser.

Bright-white structured collars and elaborately designed brocade dresses and jackets rounded out the line. </p>\n\n\n<p>\"We wanted the hair to have a sense of winter to it,\" said Odile Gilbert, who created the coifs this season. \"It's very simple, but there's a little electricity running through it.\" Gilbert used mousse and K&#233;rastase hair spray to create a textured look that was influenced by the models' natural hair. Locks were meant to appear dirty and ratty with static, as if the models had just removed their snow caps. </p>\n\n<p>\"The makeup is just really simple,\" said Diane Kendal who worked with Jill Stuart's makeup line (available in Asia and at Jill Stuart boutiques). \"We kept the skin clean with just a thin line of eyeliner. This girl is cool, so she doesn't need much.\" </p>\n\n<p>The end result was a perfect combination of classic English heritage mixed with the hip downtown London vibe that It girls like Tennant and Alexa Chung embody so well. </p>\n<!-- Start of Brightcove Player -->\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">\n\n</div>\n\n<!--\nBy use of this code snippet, I agree to the Brightcove Publisher T and C \nfound at https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/. \n-->\n\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"></script>\n\n<object id=\"myExperience2153891770001\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n  <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n  <param name=\"width\" value=\"480\" />\n  <param name=\"height\" value=\"270\" />\n  <param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1697316507001\" />\n  <param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAAABYxIBg~,iuV76rCkkDDhCm16wBI3cvDgs1AB1eVh\" />\n  <param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n  <param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n  <param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" />\n  \n  <param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"2153891770001\" />\n</object>\n\n<!-- \nThis script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon\nas the line is read by the browser.

It's basically Spring! Which means it's snog season! Official! SATSG Laura Jane MacBeth explains why (exclamation mark)</strong>\n\n<p>I don't know about you, but here in Laura world, the last few days of ACTUAL SUNSHINE (soz if it hasn't reached you yet, but here in SE London it's practically tropical) have got me in a seriously smiley mood. I skip to the shops to pick up a paper, I dance down to Sainsbos to pick up my dinner, and I practically kicked my heels on the way to the GYM yesterday, all due to some much-needed Vitamin D and the suggestion (however brrr it still actually is) of Summer and all it's balmy, bikini-clad, bbq-based FUN. Not to mention boys, of which more now.</p><p>Because according to a new study by the University of South Brittany, even when it's not ridic hot of a 111 in the shade nature, we're naturally flirtier when it's sunny. They sent five 'physically attractive' 20 year olds out on the streets in the name of dating science to approach women and say Hello. My name's Antoine. I just want to say that I think you&#146;re really pretty. I have to go to work this afternoon, and I was wondering if you would give me your phone number. I&#146;ll phone you later and we can have a drink together someplace.' The men were instructed to smile, gaze at the woman, and wait 10 seconds for her response (quite long, slight awks). The results revealed that more than 20 per cent of the women gave out their numbers on sunny days, while just 13.9 per cent accepted the offer of a date on cloudy days. Way to go summer Antoine! Check you getting numbers and stuff with your smooth sun-based moves!</p><p>The study's author Nicolas Gueguen concluded that people tend to be in better moods on sunny days or men could be better at flirting in good weather - possibly given the general lack of face, hair and conversation wrecking wind, rain, sleet and snow, and the profusion of actually flattering, flesh-flashing clothing items. But hey, just because it's well obvs, doesn't mean we shouldn't get excited about it. Or use it as an excuse to perform the annual Winter to Summer wardrobe swap which I will be embarking upon today.</p><p>YAY! SUMMER! DRESSES! SNOGS!

In over an hour, I heard nothing more than the gentle call of birds and the rustle of wind stirring up rust- and gold-coloured leaves among the ash, oak and birch trees. My hideaway for a few days was almost completely camouflaged by the branches, but a reassuring trail of smoke billowing from the chimney helped me retrace my footsteps through the mist to the wooden hut. Woodsman&#146;s Cabin, the idyllic woodland eco-retreat that my husband Mike and I had booked for a relaxing weekend away, is most definitely off the beaten track.<br /><br />While I was out, Mike had been busy stoking the woodburning stove, lighting candles as the daylight faded, as there is no electricity here, and browsing the Walk through the forest (top), sample tempting produce at Nontron&#146;s Saturday morning market, then return to the sanctuary of the cabin in-house entertainment for the night ahead &#150; would it be Scrabble, chess or a game of hand-drawn Hangman played to the soothing murmur of Serge Gainsbourg from the tiny speakers of the wind-up radio? These simple pleasures were all part of the cabin&#146;s charm.<br /><br />Built by owners Bob and Di Kirkwood (who live nearby), it includes solar panels to power a light or two briefly, a purifier to make water from the nearby lake safe to drink, and the compost loo uses sawdust (saved from the construction). But while Woodsman&#146;s Cabin has impressive green credentials, it also has plenty of thoughtful extras, such as pots of Di&#146;s jam for breakfast, made with her neighbour&#146;s home-grown strawberries. Wellies and umbrellas are provided, as well as hot water bottles for particularly cold nights (the cabin is available to hire over Christmas when temperatures can plummet below freezing), plus parasols and mosquito repellent for the 30&#176;C summer days and starry nights when you want to sit outside on the veranda.<br /><br />Di prepared dinner for us on our first night. A Cordon Bleu-trained chef, she cooked a wonderful three-course meal of goat&#146;s cheese souffl&#233;, pork with dauphinoise potatoes and pear tarte tatin by candlelight, effortlessly using the cabin&#146;s small gas oven. Di and her husband Bob, a professional carpenter, relocated to the Dordogne 13 years ago from Essex, having stumbled across the P&#233;rigord-Limousin area while on holiday. They knew they&#146;d found something truly special. Formerly marshland, the Dordogne was drained in the 19th century and is now an area of diverse habitats including more than 8,800 lakes, forest, arable farmland and productive vineyards. Wildlife is therefore abundant: kingfishers, red kites and white admiral butterflies are commonly seen in spring and summer, while in autumn, when the woodlands become a vivid mix of oranges, reds and ambers, you might catch a glimpse of deer and red squirrels.<br /><br />Our visit was in early November, and the wet weather meant the cabin came into its own. We chose to stay dry in our cosy hideaway, drawing the homemade curtains and relishing the chance to have some undistracted conversation (there&#146;s no mobile phone reception here). In lieu of television, we watched flames flicker in the stove and on the candles that dotted every available surface. Such a pared-back existence was, in itself, refreshing. Without artificial lighting, we went to bed earlier than usual, in tune with our bodies&#146; natural rhythm, and woke the following morning with daylight, the sound of a donkey in the distance and the scamper of a squirrel above the attic bedroom our only alarm. And we had all we needed inside, thanks to a supply of staples such as milk, pasta and chocolate biscuits, which guests can purchase by way of an honesty pot.<br /><br />To tempt us outside, though, were the bikes that Bob had left for us to explore the surrounding area, the shelves of walking maps for navigating the woods and there&#146;s even a bathtub-sized rowing boat for paddling around the lake &#150; or fishing from, if you so fancy. Venturing further afield, we meandered through sleepy, quintessential French villages and market towns on narrow country lanes. We visited historic landmarks such as the spot in Nontron where Richard the Lionheart was struck by a fatal arrow; the &#145;Venice of the Pe&#769;rigord&#146;, Branto&#770;me, with its ancient abbey, formal gardens and antiques shops situated in caves, carved deep into the valley&#146;s rocks; and Saint Este&#768;phe, a village where, in summer, you can play on the beach or swim in the Grand Etang lake, or, on damp weekends like ours, sip from a mug of hot chocolate while perusing the French bric-a-brac on sale at Le Petit Baigneur.<br /><br />After a trip to Nontron&#146;s Saturday morning market, we headed back to the cabin with a freshly baked baguette, regional Cabe&#769;cou goat&#146;s cheese and a bottle of red wine for dinner. There was a chill in the air as we revived the fire, and some fumbling with matches until we&#146;d created enough light &#150; but we&#146;d come to look forward to these simple rituals, and they formed the many happy memories we brought home.</p>\n<h3>Getting there&#133;</h3>\n<p>Woodsman&#146;s Cabin sleeps two and costs from &#163;58 per night.

believed his 16-ounce jar of Crazy Richard's <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/peanut-butter-lover-seeks-5m-airport-jam-article-1.1258474\" target=\"_blank\">peanut butter was a liquid bomb</a> &#151; has other problems. Here's what happened:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>Frank Hannibal claims in a complaint filed in Brooklyn Federal Court that he wound up in the sticky situation when the screener noticed the layer of oil atop his gourmet peanut butter &#151; and ordered him out of the line.<br /><br />\n\n\"They're looking to confiscate my explosives,\" Hannibal sarcastically told his wife and twin 6-year-old daughters, the court papers state.<br /><br />\n\nThe TSA worker, identified in the papers as Edwin Sanchez, overheard Hannibal, apparently didn&#146;t get the joke &#151; and called the cops.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's ignore the fact that a layer of oil is <a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=oily+peanut+butter\" target=\"_blank\">actually supposed to be there</a> and focus on the notion that Hannibal went through 25 hours in the slammer and is now bringing a $5-million-dollar lawsuit against the TSA over a peanut butter that cost him $6.99.</p>\n<p>This is all wrong. Crazy Richard's is chump change. The peanut butter to sue over is this one: <a href=\"https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/view_detail.cfm?srm=2387\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Reference Material No. 2387</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it's the perfect peanut butter, engineered to precision and accompanied by scientific documentation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST apparently does exactly what its name says: create standards for common food products like peanut butter, <a href=\"https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/\" target=\"_blank\">ferrous and nonferrous metals, primary gas mixtures, and other nebulous science-speaky categories</a>. For some reason, they have peanut butter, too, and it sells for about $220 for a 6-ounce jar, creamy.</p>\n\n<p>Crazy Richards' just doesn't seem worth the same effort.</p>\n\n\n<p><a

Treating the horses and their owners right has paid off for Amanda Steege as much as her considerable ability in the saddle. Putting the horses first is what it's all about for Steege, whose Ashmeadow Farm is based during the warm months in Bedminster and during the winter in Ocala, Fla. Although the 2013 season is young, she already has been winning at the HITS shows there, where she has 18 horses at her stable, and also works with numerous ship-ins and people who meet her at the ring.But Steege is admired for more than her competitive efforts.\"She's the consummate horsewoman, she does everything in the most wonderfully correct way,\" said Olympic show jumping team gold medalist Peter Wylde, who has known her since she was a child.\"Her whole family has lived and breathed horses all their lives. I have the utmost respect for Amanda and her operation. She's really A-plus.\"Between high school and college, Steege worked for Wylde, who can't say enough about the 37-year-old equestrian.\"She didn't come from great means; she always had average horses to ride; not bad, but not glamorous, expensive horses like a lot of kids had. Amanda made the best of it with a smile on her face, always,\" Wylde said. \"I rode whatever came along,\" noted Steege. \" I was a hard working kid, but I was not a famous junior rider.\" She qualified for the equitation finals \"but I certainly wasn't the dominator or the person to beat.\"Steege grew up in Massachusetts, the daughter of equestrian professionals Mitch and Kathy Steege. Her mother teaches 70 beginner lessons a week at their Red Acre Farm; her father has a business similar to hers, and she does some riding for him still, while her sister, Casey, has a horse lay-up and retirement place in Ocala.Steege started working out of her parents' facility, then moved to New Jersey 12 years ago. Her first client, Megan McGuire, came from Whitehouse Station, and the husband of another client, Pam Wildman, had been transferred to Johnson &amp; Johnson in the area.\"It was sort of a natural progression to end up there,\" said Steege, who is a fan of the Somerset Hills.\"I love it there. It's so horsey and so convenient for great vets and great farriers, and so easy to get to the places we travel to,\" said Steege, who works with her boyfriend, Tim Delovith. A Centenary College equine program graduate, he is her barn manager and previously worked at Carol Thompson's Quiet Winter Farm in Colts Neck.Her earliest major victory came in 2001, in her first outing as a professional at Devon, when she won the second-year green hunter championship on Unseen. Last season, one of Steege's biggest moments was finishing third in the world's richest hunter class, the $500,000 HITS Diamond Mills Hunter Prix in Saugerties, N.Y., on Lisa Arena's Balou, second in the country in the second-year green division. The horses that were first and second, Sienna and C Coast Z, were much more experienced than Balou, but under Steege's guidance, her mount stepped in to win the $60,000 prize with a beautiful round.She could see it coming. Steege has used a psychology degree from Boston College after graduating 13th in her class to get herself and some of her clients prepared to do well by using visualization techniques.She has all amateur clients, some of whom get nervous, so they appreciate her help. And she understands what they're feeling.\"I'm for sure a perfectionist, I want everything to go as smoothly as possible. If you see me at the ingate and about to go in and I'm not nervous, I should stop doing this, because that means I won't be caring about it. It's not nervous like I think I'm not capable of it, it's nervous because I want everything to go as perfectly as possible,\" she said, and that's where the psychology comes in.\"Visualization is the big one for me. When you look at the course, you know for a particular horse which parts are going to be bad. Say you have a horse who's not pretty at the trot jump. I try not to let myself think, 'I hope I don't mess up the trot jump.' Instead, I try to think of the things I need to do to make the trot jump go as well as it can. When I am standing at the ingate at Devon, I know which lines are going to be more difficult for me, I take that and find a quiet place and I go over the course in my head, almost like I'm watching it on a video. Sometimes, if I'm a little bit nervous, the first time I watch it, I'll watch it going wrong. Then I sit there and make myself stop and rewind and start again until I picture myself on the horse and it's going perfectly. I zero in on what my hands, legs or body are doing at key moments to help the horse get straight or fix my pace. Then I go in there and it seems like it happens before I think about it. I don't always have time to do it, but I try to do it before big classes.\"ON THE RAIL It's been a bad week for injuries in the horse world. Eventer Andrea Leatherman suffered a concussion and other injuries Friday after her mount, Neveah, had a rotational fall on the fourth obstacle on the intermediate cross-country course at the Florida Horse Park in Ocala. The mare caught her front legs on the front of a table oxer and landed with her head and neck on her rider. It was a fatal accident for the horse Leatherman regained consciousness and was taken to the hospital for treatment.

For the film's opening sequence, 600 extras from Sacramento were brought in by train to reenact the dangerous Yukon trek. The Trukee Ski Club helped clear a 2300-foot single file path near Donner Summit, and what is now the Sugar Bowl Ski Resort. The film was spectacular, but at a price. Many of the cast and crew became sick during shooting because of the harsh conditions.\n<br /><br />\nReprising his role as The Little Tramp, Chaplin found his comic pratfalls difficult to control in the frigid conditions, and after coming down with the flu, he finally agreed to return to Hollywood. Once back in the studio, work began on the creation of a miniature mountain range, constructed from timber (reportedly a quarter-of-a-million feet), chicken wire, and burlap. Salt and flour were used in lieu of snow, and the resulting snowscape was surprisingly convincing on film. To film the Miner's hut teetering on the edge of the cliff, studio technicians created a miniature model and filmed the scene so smoothly that the cut from the full-size set to the model is hard to detect.","slide_title":"<em>The Gold Rush</em> (1925)","custom_slide_links":[{"slide_links":[{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":1,"link_url":"","link_thumb_url":"","link_title":"","link_text":""}],"__total_count__":1,"link_heading":""}],"slide_credit":"","slide_links_type":"Magnus","sponsorship":"Nothing","slide_type":"Image"}],"publish_date":"2013-02-09T05:00:00.000Z","article_type_name":"Flip Book 3","import_chan_id":null,"partner_related_links_list_article":[],"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"21029","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"version":"1","author_last_name":"Davis","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"article_type_prefix":"flipbook3","in_this_issue_text":"","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"15078077","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1365","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T06:05:04.000Z","author_id":"52566","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"contributor_country":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2033-02-09T05:00:00.000Z","import_region_id":null,"origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/visual-effects/snow-job-how-hollywood-fakes-winter-on-film","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Kira Plastinina and friends model her label's latest collection.","site_id":"17","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.harpersbazaar.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"new york fall 2013, fashion week, Lublu, kira plastinina","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"It Girls Take to the Streets in Lublu Fall 2013","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-02-09T15:28:16.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Kerry","source_id":"1","teaser":"Kira Plastinina and friends model her label's latest collection.","sub_heading":"Kira Plastinina's name first registered in the US as a result of her eponymous, pink-inflected mass fashion stores, which continue their global expansion.

the most anticipated shows of the season, Rag & Bone proved once again to be a tour de force of creativity. Designers Marcus Wainwright and David Neville teamed up with Revlon global art director (and wife of Neville) Gucci Westman and Redken stylist Guido Palau to create the beauty look for the show. Dr. Dre blasted from Westman's station, and all seemed calm while the creatives waited for the storm (both literally and figuratively) to roll in. Wainwright circled the room snapping pictures while Neville and Westman joked about her Celine platforms. \"David hates them,\" said Westman, who was wearing pieces from the new collection. \"But I wanted them to match the girls.\" </p><br /><br />\n\n\n<p>The brand's look this season was reminiscent of Spring 2013's '60s mod girl but with a classic edge to her. \"She's a bit inspired by Edie Sedgwick with a very low side part,\" said Palau. \"It's not a hard silhouette, it should feel like you've done it with your hands.\"</p><br /><br />\n\n\n\n<p>In true Rag & Bone spirit, the makeup for the runway was a juxtaposition of the cool girl who embodies the brand's aesthetic and the simple, classicism that Gucci Westman brings to the table. \"There's such an element of the '60s in the clothes,\" said Westman. \"Having the defined line in the [eye] crease is so reminiscent of that era, but this time, we took it straight out, not curved. That made if very pretty and a bit of edgy.\"</p><br /><br />\n\n\n<p>Jin Soon Choi kept the nails \"short and nude\" to compliment the graphics of the clothing. \"It's almost like putting a foundation on the nails, that's always pretty.\"</p><br /><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/elle/images/IS/elle-01-fashion-week-fall-2013-rag-and-bone-backstage-beauty-0208-mdn.jpg\"><br /><br />\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: Rag & Bone</p><br /><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/elle/images/6Z/elle-03-fashion-week-fall-2013-rag-and-bone-backstage-beauty-0208-mdn.jpg\"><br /><br />\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: Rag & Bone</p><br /><br />\n\n"}],"blog_author":""}],"publish_date":"2013-02-09T03:50:00.000Z","article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","import_chan_id":null,"partner_related_links_list_article":[],"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"21944","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"version":"1","author_last_name":"Barringer","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"tbarringer","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","in_this_issue_text":"","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"15077906","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2013-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T03:51:50.000Z","author_id":"82678","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"contributor_country":null,"origin_site_prefix":"elle","import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2033-02-08T05:00:00.000Z","import_region_id":null,"origin_site_name":"ELLE","allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.elle.com/news/beauty-makeup/beautyrag-and-bone-fall2013-nyfw","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Suno's Hair and Makeup Test for Fall 2013.","site_id":"817","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.elle.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"suno, suno 2013, suno fall, suno makeup look, suno hair look","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Video: Suno's Hair and Makeup Test","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-02-09T02:56:35.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Taylor","source_id":"1","teaser":"Suno's Hair and Makeup Test for Fall 2013.","sub_heading":"ELLE.com was given exclusive access to the Suno hair and makeup tests at the designers' showroom the night before the show.","origin_site_id":"817","description":"ELLE.com goes behind the scenes to bring you an exclusive look at the Suno hair and makeup test for their Fall 2013 runway show.","url_name":"suno-fall-2013-hair-and-makeup-test","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2013-02-09T00:57:20.000Z","title":"Exclusive: Suno's Hair and Makeup Test","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Suno Fall 2013 Makeup Tests - Suno Fall 2013 Hair and Makeup","allow_comment":"1","contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"author":{"organization_id":"1","site_id":"817","active":"Y","nick_name":null,"last_name":"Barringer","last_updated_by":"llevinson","email":null,"creation_date":"2012-11-02T19:39:28.000Z","id":"82678","title":null,"last_updated_date":"2012-11-02T19:39:28.000Z","first_name":"Taylor"},"body":"<p class=\"p1\">Erin Beatty and Max Osterweis, purveyors of print, pulled inspiration from the medieval clans and aristocrats for this years collection. \"The clothes are a lot cleaner and sharper, so we wanted the models to be just simple, cool girls,\" says Beatty.&#160; Surrounded by inspiring Suno-esque paraphernalia (mid-century modern furniture, vintage playing cards in glass slides, large colorful paintings, woven tapestries) and pumping a playlist of ethereal cultural beats, the duo worked hand in hand with Odile Gilbert and Carole Colombani to bring the Suno Girl to life.&#160;</p>\n\n<p class=\"p4\">\"The hair is very electric, almost static-y,\" says Gilbert, who fluffed the rounded ponytails to create a halo of fly-aways. \"The clothes are so dark this season, we wanted the makeup to be simple but beautiful,\" explained Colombani, who contoured the model's cheeks before rimming her eyes in beige, nude, and terra-cotta M.A.C. shades. \"She's just a cool girl,\" exclaimed Beatty, perhaps describing not just the girl of Suno, but the girl of the season.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p4\">The end result was a fresh, modern girl, who is both approachable but cool, exactly what Suno embodies.&#160;</p>\n<!-- Start of Brightcove Player -->\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">\n\n</div>\n\n<!--\nBy use of this code snippet, I agree to the Brightcove Publisher T and C \nfound at https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/. \n-->\n\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"></script>\n\n<object id=\"myExperience\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n  <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n  <param name=\"width\" value=\"620\" />\n  <param name=\"height\" value=\"352\" />\n  <param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1661958612001\" />\n  <param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAAABYxIBg~,iuV76rCkkDB3E0Fx-Gsv2FNkPvZYzZUJ\" />\n  <param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n  <param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n  <param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"@videoList\" value=\"2149022618001\" />\n<param name=\"@videoList.featured\" value=\"2151987117001\" />\n  \n</object>\n\n<!-- \nThis script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon\nas the line is read by the browser.

In the wake of Galliano being fired by Dior after he made anti-Semitic comments in 2011, and after Galliano reportedly attended rehab, Field was one of Galliano&#146;s few vocal supporters among the fashion community. We asked Field about her reaction to Galliano&#146;s working with de la Renta.</p><br /><br />\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>&#147;I&#146;m so happy, I think it&#146;s wonderful; when I see Oscar, I&#146;m going to give him a big hug,&#148; Field said. &#147;Of course I love John [Galliano&#146;s] work, but that&#146;s not the issue at all. What pissed me off is that Galliano literally brought back the House of Dior, and I believe that they could have treated him a little nicer. Maybe he was worn out or maybe he was high [when he made the comments]. They should have protected him. He brought the House of Dior back, and the repayment to him for what he did was disgraceful. Forget that he&#146;s a genius, forget that he&#146;s my friend. I&#146;m from the school of, if someone does a great thing for you, then you never forget that. When you have the opportunity to protect that person, you don&#146;t kick him in the street.&#148;</p><br /><br />\n\n<p>Also controversial was the decision not to ask Field to design for <i>The Carrie Diaries</i>. Sarah Jessica Parker had originally asked Field to design some of her outfits for <i>Sex and the City</i>, which led not only to Field becoming chief designer on that show, but also designer for both <i>Sex and the City</i> movies, as well as <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>. Field&#146;s assistant on <i>Sex and the City</i>, <a href=\"http://www.elle.com/news/fashion-style/eric-daman-discusses-80s-fashion-before-the-premiere-of-the-carrie-diaries\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Daman, was chosen to design its prequel</a>, <i>The Carrie Diaries</i>, but Field has no hard feelings. &#147;Eric did <i>Gossip Girl</i>, so he is like &#145;the designer for CW,&#146;\" she noted. \"So when the CW decided to do <i>The Carrie Diaries</i>, he was the natural choice, since he was also my assistant.&#148;</p><br /><br />\n\n<p>Recently Field has branched out into other areas, without leaving fashion behind. &#147;I am developing an assortment of projects, from merchandising to movies,\" she said. \"I own two film properties that I will be developing. Mostly, they are comedies but of course they will be fashion-based.&#148;</p><br /><br />\n\n<p>Field has always been a supporter of avant-garde, edgy, inventive young designers, and Concept Korea is no exception. Field was enthusiastic about Choiboko, Cres. E Dim., Kye, Lie Sang Bong and Son Jung Wan: &#147;The workmanship and the level of the technology, the construction of the garments, is so advanced and is so strong. They are definitely a thumbs-up for me. It is really wonderful to see.&#148; Particularly notable were Choiboko&#146;s deconstructed jackets and mid-calf pencil skirts, Kye&#146;s on-trend black-and-white prints (some of which were inspired by 80&#146;s graffiti) and strongest of all, Lie sang bong&#146;s cross-hatch and hi-tech geometric graphic prints.</p><br /><br />\n\n<p>Also in Concept Korea&#146;s front row were Fern Mallis, Phillip Bloch, Angela Simmons, Simon Collins, and Neon Hitch.</p><br /><br />\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.elle.com/runway/ready-to-wear/fall-2013-rtw/\" target=\"_blank\">See all the&#160;Fall 2013&#160;Ready-to-Wear collections.</a></b><br /><br />\n<b><a href=\"http://www.elle.com/rss/news/\" target=\"_blank\">Keep up to date on the latest breaking fashion news stories.</a></b><br /><br />\n\n</td></tr></tbody></table> \n<img src=\"/cm/elle/images/An/elle-concept-korea-runway-de.jpg\"><br /><br />\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: Dan Lecca </p><br /><br />\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2013-02-08T22:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"21944","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Cwelich","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"dzhekova","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"15076017","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/fashion/spotlight/playing-field-24778\">Playing Field </a><br>\n<a href=\"/accessories/shop-accessories/bags/Coach-Legacy-Patricia-Bag\">Coach Legacy Patricia Bag</a><br>\n<a href=\"/pop-culture/reviews/stylistas-cast-261135\">Stylista's Cast</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/day-2-ny-spring-07-video-420671292\">Day 2, NY Spring '07 Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/lilac-fields-nail-tutorial-video-27832995001\">Lilac Fields Nail Tutorial Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/pop-culture/celebrities/new-school-your-field-guide-to-the-breakout-stars-of-2010-518882\">New School: Your Field Guide to the Breakout Stars of 2010</a><br>\n<a href=\"/runway/ready-to-wear/spring-2013-rtw/john-galliano/backstage/\">John Galliano Spring 2013 Ready-to-Wear Backstage</a><br>\n<a href=\"/runway/ready-to-wear/spring-2013-rtw/john-galliano/collection/\">John Galliano Spring 2013 Ready-to-Wear Collection</a><br>\n<a href=\"/runway/ready-to-wear/spring-2013-rtw/john-galliano/detail/\">John Galliano Spring 2013 Ready-to-Wear Detail</a><br>\n<a href=\"/runway/ready-to-wear/fall-2012-rtw/john-galliano/backstage/\">John Galliano </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2013-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T15:07:08.000Z","author_id":"43442","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"elle","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2033-02-08T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"ELLE","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.elle.com/news/fashion-style/patricia-field-john-galliano-concept-korea-new-york-fashion-week","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"13","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.esquire.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Out On The Weekend","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-02-08T22:32:08.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Charles P.","source_id":"1","teaser":null,"origin_site_id":"13","sub_heading":null,"pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"Snowmageddon_Weekend","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2013-02-08T21:47:37.000Z","title":"Out On The Weekend","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Out On The Weekend","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"1","active":"Y","site_id":"13","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":null,"last_name":"Pierce","email":null,"creation_date":"2007-01-29T19:53:40.000Z","id":"68","last_updated_date":"2007-01-29T19:53:40.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Charles P."},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":[{"sponblog_check":"No","blog_element":[{"__total_count__":1,"paragraph":"<p>(Permanent Musical&#160;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXAXHWnfRQo\" target=\"_blank\">Accompaniment</a> To The Last Post Of The Week From The Blog's Second-Favorite Canadian.)</p>\n<p>Thirty-five years ago this week, I caught the No. 15 bus from Worcester to Shrewsbury. It fishtailed going up the hill to my parents' house. It was the last bus to run on that route for three days. That was the Blizzard of 1978, which didn't have a cute name, but which damned near blew up the entire coastline and was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime event.

(Local TV -- all logo'ed and theme-music'ed up already -- &#160;then went out of its way to assure us that those penalties were merely a threat.) In 1978, that call got made pretty late in the game and we ended up with abandoned vehicles all over Route 128. So, give it 35 years, and two Storms of two different Centuries, and the Commonwealth (God save it!) will figure things out for itself. We have been under a Severe French Toast Alert -- Buy milk! Buy bread! Buy an indulgence! Buy more milk! -- for a couple of days now, so all the hunkering that needs to be done has been hunkered. But, sitting here waiting for the worst of a blizzard to rise over New England, I have only one real question.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/08/16900348-women-shot-during-lapd-ex-cop-manhunt-had-no-warning-lawyer-says?lite\" target=\"_blank\">Am I really safe from the LAPD?</a></p>\n<p>I'm no Mel Kiper when it comes to judging football talent, but <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/arkansas-recruit-mother-steals-letter-intent-fax-goes-175746886--ncaaf.html\" target=\"_blank\">I have to wonder</a> about Alex Collins's speed if his mother can steal his letter and run away from him.</p>\n<p>Dear America's Journalists: The Onion is not real news.

I say, 'Try to wait until you get out of the office.'\"\n<br /><br />\nHis latest patient? His wife (and co-star) Veronica Matlock, who hopped into the gynecological stirrups, had a speculum inserted, was stuck with one needle to be numbed, and then injected with the G-shot's hyaluronic acid. Afterward, Dr. Matlock inserted a tampon for her (as he does with all of his patients), to absorb any bleeding. Didn't the whole ordeal hurt like a mother?\n<br /><br />\n\"It's no more uncomfortable than getting a pap smear,\" Veronica, who lovingly nicknamed her husband \"The Vagina Man,\" told Cosmopolitan.com. \"He examined me and asked me, 'Is the spot closer to you or closer to me?' You know he's there when gets to an area where it almost feels like you have to urinate.\"\n<p><img src=\"/cm/cosmopolitan/images/hu/cos-gshot-Pbi3dx-mdn.jpg\" align=\"top\" style=\"padding:0 10px 10px 0;\"></p> \nIn fact, the Matlocks say they were both turned on by the controversial shot, which holds the promise of more wow-worthy sex&#151;and the risk of side effects like <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/male-sex-drive\" target=\"_blank\">lower libido</a>. \n<br /><br />\nBut does it really work? Perhaps unsurprisingly, Veronica reports \"fabulous\" results, saying her shot \"enhanced sex big-time,\" including more arousal, and a <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips-moves/how-to-have-orgasm\" target=\"_blank\">heightened orgasm</a>.  \n<br /><br />\nBut even with its high price tag and risk factor, (Dr. Matlock claims trials have returned no side effects, but not much research has been done on G-shots) don't expect a G-shot to completely revolutionize your roll in the hay. In fact, even Dr. Matlock says the ideal patient is a woman who is having pretty good sex already, and just wants to take it up a notch. \n<br /><br />\n\"If someone has a sexual dysfunction, a G-shot won't cure it. If a woman comes in and says, 'I just don't have vaginal orgasms,' that is perfectly normal, but the G-shot isn't right,\" he said. \n<br /><br />\nThe G-shot doesn't last forever, either.

Taylor apparently doesn't think the Biebs is \"right for her.\"<br /><br />\n\nWhile Tay may be the last person I would take relationship advice from (<a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/news/taylor-swift-harry-styles-breaku\" target=\"_blank\">ahem</a>), I love the girl for being there for her BFF. It's always good to have your girl's back, especially when she's going through a hard time like a breakup.<br /><br />\n\nBut is being blunt with how much you dislike him the proper way to help your friend through a split? Some experts say no.<br /><br />\n\nMarni Battista, founder of <a href=\"http://datingwithdignity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">datingwithdignity.com</a>, says \"The best way to show up like a true best friend during a breakup is to be a strong listener. Acknowledge her pain, talk about how great she was as a girlfriend. Avoid giving advice or your opinion.  What your friend needs now is not for you to tell her what to do.\"<br /><br />\n\nAnd while you'll want to bash his ass and go off on how much of a douche he probably was, don't. Life coach and relationship expert <a href=\"http://custommadelife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Irina Baranov</a> says it's prob best to not trash her ex. \"While it may seem like the right thing to do in the moment, you&#146;re essentially telling your friend two things: 1. She made a terrible choice to be with someone so bad. 2. You disapprove of the possibility of her going back to him, which might happen and it often does.\"<br /><br />\n\nYikes. I wish I knew this a year ago. I helped a former friend get over her ex (who broke up with her over the phone...yeah.) and I made the mistake of telling her how much she didn't need him and blah, blah. You know, I was there for her. I listened to her pour her heart out to me when I was at work and late at night. So when the sob-filled texts and phone calls stopped, I got suspicious. I thought she was finally over him. Nope. I eventually found out they got back together. Long story short, we're no longer friends because I pointed out that she stopped talking to me once she got back with her man...and she wasn't too pleased with that.<br /><br />\n\nHey. I was just trying to be a good friend. But uh, now I know how to <i>properly</i> help a girlfriend get over her ex.<br /><br />\n\nWant more from Dara?

The least of them would be that a Bachmann campaign would blow out all the circuits in Karl Rove's brain. Is she a mainstream Republican or a Tea Partier? (I'd say by now she's pretty much the latter, but she started out as the kind of conservative congresscritter that Rove dedicated his previous life to producing.) And could Senator Franken really resist the temptation to reach back into the techniques of his previous career when faced with this big a fish in this small a barrel?

That's thanks to the good folks at <a href=\"http://www.eccodomani.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ecco Domani</a> &#151; producers of very good wine and patrons of the fashion world &#151; and their Fashion Foundation. Velardi was this year's men's-wear <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/blogs/mens-fashion/ian-velardi-ecco-domani-fashion-foundation-award-2013\" target=\"_blank\">winner</a>, and, aside from the (well-deserved) recognition, he got a nice big grant to take his label to the next level. We caught up with Ian at the brunch celebrating all the award-winners to chat about his presentation, mixing casual and tailored looks, and what's next for the man behind the collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Esquire.com:</strong> Congrats on the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Ian Velardi:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Does it feel like you&#146;ve arrived, now that this has happened to you? Or is it just the next step?&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>IV:</strong> It&#146;s definitely a huge honor. And it gives me an opportunity to really show my collection in a creative manner, which I haven't been able to do before. I&#146;ve been showing for sales appointments and trade shows but never just for the purpose of presenting a line. So this is the first time I&#146;m doing that, and it&#146;s great. It puts my collection in front of a lot of people that I&#146;ve not been able to show it to in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Do you have any big plans for your presentation?</p>\n<p><strong>IV:</strong> My presentation is very, very simple. Ecco Domani has given me a very generous grant to put on the presentation, but there are still a lot of limitations as a new designer. A lot of the grant is allocated to making samples, because I typically don&#146;t make enough to dress 15 or so looks at one time. So I&#146;m scrambling to make a lot of samples, and I&#146;m keeping the presentation very simple. You know, just focus on the clothing. There are a lot of things I'd love to do and hope to be able to do in the future, but for now it&#146;s just focusing on the clothing and making it clean and simple.</p>\n\n<p><div style=\"float: center; width: 614px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"> <p style=\"line-height: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #545454; font-size: 10px;\"> <img src=\"/cm/esquire/images/zJ/esq-ian-velardi-ecco-domani-brunch-020813-xlg.jpg\" /><i>IAN, WITH A FEW OF THE ECCO DOMANI FASHION FOUNDATION JUDGES</i></span></p> </div>\n\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> I had a chance to check out fall 2013, and it seems like there's a bit of an athletic influence to it.&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>IV:</strong> I&#146;m very influenced by true sportswear &#151; actual active wear, especially heritage-inspired active wear. And I just felt like this season it was the right time to show some of these ideas I&#146;ve had. A USA sweatshirt and sweatpants and stuff like that just seemed to make sense right now, mixed with some of the tailored elements, just for a more casual touch. It's a nod to vintage Olympic attire, which I envision being more mixed with a more tailored look.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> We&#146;ve been seeing that pick up steam recently, that mix of tailored and athletic.</p>\n<p><strong>IV:</strong> Yeah, it&#146;s been happening for a while now. But, you know, every season you just kind of look at it from a different angle.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> So fall 2013 is in the home stretch now. Are you starting to think about next spring?</p>\n<p><strong>IV:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I&#146;m always thinking ahead. You kind of have to be thinking at least a year ahead, which is wild. I have folders on my desktop where I&#146;m just constantly storing ideas away &#151; for spring, for fall. And hopefully I&#146;ll get to all of them at at some point. But any time I have an idea, any time I see something I like, it&#146;s like, &#147;OK, drag it into that folder.&#148; So yeah, always thinking spring, always thinking fall. I hope that my message is consistent forever and it&#146;s not just a seasonal idea or a trend, but rather an idea that&#146;s consistent with my line always. I hope to establish those iconic ideas and elements that really speak for the brand &#151;&#160;to always introduce new things for the season, but remain grounded in what I do.</p>\n\n\n"}],"blog_author":""}],"publish_date":"2013-02-08T21:06:00.000Z","article_type_name":"Blog Entry

We're really skeptical about this, so we asked Rebecca O'Sullivan, an esthetician at Chicago's <a href=\"http://www.sinequanonsalons.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sine Qua Non Salon</a>, to tell us more about this questionable DIY facial.\n<br /><br />\n\"I would <i>not</i> put kitty litter on my face,\" O'Sullivan says. \"Some brands of kitty litter contain aluminium silicate, the same ingredient used in glass-making as well as housing insulation. Plus, it's a known neurotoxin for humans.\"\n<br /><br />\nPhan stresses using unscented kitty litter to avoid the added chemicals, but even the purest of kitty litters can tear your skin.\n<br /><br />\n\"Facial skin is more sensitive and thinner than the rest of the body,\" O'Sullivan says. \"You may notice some skin tears, breakouts, and even premature fine lines. Any type of scrub that is not a 'rounded' shape has a tendency to cause these issues.\"\n<br /><br />\nAs for the clearing effect Phan felt on her skin?

Luckily, I had warned him a couple days before that this would be my new tension-busting tactic, so he was only slightly annoyed by my spontaneous hip-shaking. Needless to say, my super cool dance moves did not magically end our conflict.<br /><br />\n\nThough, my heart&#151;and head&#151;were kinda in the right place with my poor attempt at making light of the situation: According to <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/sfpa-hco020713.php\" target=\"_blank\">a new study</a>, humor <i>can</i> help diffuse tense conflicts in relationships. However, the <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/relationship-advice/male-insecurities\" target=\"_blank\">type of humor</a> can make all the difference. In studying couples, researchers found that self-defeating humor actually elicited a negative response from the other partner, while humor that was \"affiliative\"&#151;as in, not made at the person's own expense&#151;helped ease tension. (Making myself look a fool could be considered self-defeating, I suppose, right?)<br /><br />\n\nTo learn more about how  to use humor during a fight, I talked to <a href=\"http://www.doctorreef.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Reef Karim, MD</a>, assistant clinical professor at UCLA and the author of the forthcoming book <i>What Does He Do That? Why Does She Do That?</i>. His philosophy is that laughter can help heal relationships and remove tension. \"So, when you have an argument with your significant other, shifting the argument to a funny moment can absolutely create a more friendly discussion,\" he says. Basically, making each other laugh when you're all fired can help you both take a time out and treat each other better in the moment.<br /><br />\n\nSo, if you're looking to lighten up an argument, try to find the humor in the situation without making jokes at your, or your partner's, expense. And, maybe don't do the Macarena. <br /><br />\n\n\nWant more from Natasha?

For example, we have <a href=\"http://thegazette.com/2013/02/06/iowa-senate-republicans-introduce-bill-to-ban-abortions/\" target=\"_blank\">the latest extravaganza </a>out of the Iowa legislature.</p>\n<p><em>Iowa Republican lawmakers are introducing legislation that would outlaw abortion and allow prosecution of doctors in Iowa.&#160;Rep. Tom Shaw, of Laurens, says he's trying to protect human life, whether \"you're a zygote, an infant, a teenager or an adult.\"&#160;The bill he introduced Wednesday would prohibit abortion from the moment of conception. Doctors who perform abortions could be charged with murder.</em></p>\n<p>Nothing done in Washington matters a damn if Republicans in the states keep voting for people like this. This is where your next generation of Republican congresscritters will come from. These are the ideas that animate your party at the local level. These are the people who hold the signs, and stuff the envelopes, and stand out in the snow, collecting signatures. The guy <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/yes-virginia-there-is-a-solution-87234.html\" target=\"_blank\">who stepped up and smacked</a> Rove the other day in the space provided by <em>Tiger Beat On The Potomac</em>? Yeah, <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/anti-choice-activist-wants-state-prosecute-women-who-have-abortions\" target=\"_blank\">he's a real prize, </a>too. But <a href=\"http://stevedeace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">he's a man of more influence</a> out in the country than either Rove or Matt Kibbe. He's a man of influence because he has a constituency -- a <em>substantial</em> constituency -- among voters without whom the Republicans cannot win, given the current galaxy of policy ideas the party is pushing. If you have a substantial constituency in your party that believes that Karl Rove is not conservative enough, then the right choice is to wonder exactly how far from the pack your ideas have caused you to stray. It's the ideas that are the problem, not the people who hold them.</p>\n<p>Whoever wins the current DC pissing match between corporate-backed independent organizations will have no influence over these people whatsoever. This is an idea that should not even arise in the mind of a sensible Republican politician, let alone become an actual bill that has to be debated. If there has been proposed a systemic approach to stopping the way bad (and unpopular) policies bubble up in the Republican party, I haven't seen it. All I see in Washington is two rich guys fighting over who gets to run Marco Rubio.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>"}],"blog_author":""}],"publish_date":"2013-02-08T19:47:00.000Z","article_type_name":"Blog Entry

On a flight or after I&#146;m wearing full makeup, I use them to clean my face. And I use the wipes right on the plane&#151;I don&#146;t care who&#146;s in the seat next to me. As soon as the plane lands, I&#146;m using them.</p>\n<p><strong>Cosmo: Can you walk us through your skincare regimen on a typical day? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>AW:</strong> It really depends on what kind of day it is. I was recently in Miami doing press, so I washed my face with the <a title=\"foaming cleanser\" href=\"http://www.soap.com/p/simple-foaming-cleanser-769986?site=CA&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc_S&utm_term=AUN-1386&utm_campaign=GoogleAW&CAWELAID=1781825829&utm_content=pla&adtype=pla&cagpspn=pla\" target=\"_blank\">foaming cleanser</a> and applied the <a title=\"protective\" href=\"http://www.walmart.com/ip/19589668?wmlspartner=wlpa&adid=22222222227000000000&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=&wl3=21486607510&wl4=&wl5=pla&veh=sem\" target=\"_blank\">protective moisturizer</a>&#151;it&#146;s the only SPF I&#146;ve tried that won&#146;t break you out&#151;and then I use the <a title=\"eye roller\" href=\"http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=381081&catid=182915&aid=338666&aparam=goobase_filler\" target=\"_blank\">revitalizing eye roller</a>.</p>\n<p>[Then,] at the end of the day I use the exfoliating wipes and eye makeup wipes, followed by the <a title=\"ydrating\" href=\"http://www.drugstore.com/simple-hydrating-light-moisturizer/qxp381071\" target=\"_blank\">hydrating light moisturizer</a>. I love that one because a pet peeve of mine is feeling like your cream is coming off on your pillow, and this doesn&#146;t feel like it&#146;s packed on yet sliding off.</p>\n<p><strong>Cosmo: What is your can&#146;t-leave-home-without beauty product? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>AW:</strong> The original <a title=\"chapstick\" href=\"http://www.chapstick.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapstick</a> is my main hang. I stock up on them like they&#146;re going out of style, which I know they aren&#146;t. I also really love this French product called Homeoplasmine, which I have to get my fancy French-living friends to get for me. It&#146;s an amazing ointment that can be used for anything.</p>\n<p><strong>Cosmo: Now let's talk fashion. Your character Marnie on <em>Girls</em> is pretty polished. Do you relate to her look in your personal life? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>AW:</strong> I think I have the capacity to be polished, but I&#146;m more of a jeans person on a regular day. But Marnie always tries to look perfect all of the time. My wish for her is that she&#146;d realize that she doesn&#146;t always have to care what people think.</p>\n<p>When I want to be presentable, I like to be put together; otherwise I don&#146;t think about what I look like. On the red carpet [though], I focus on wearing things that I can breath in and shoes that I can walk in. I think my main objective is to wear things that I&#146;ll look back on fondly. The worst possible scenario is that it&#146;s boring but I tell my stylist that&#146;s fine with me, because I&#146;d rather have that instead of not expressing myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Cosmo: Who is your style icon? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>AW:</strong> I look at Grace Kelly as my inspiration and I try to emulate her as best as I can.</p>\n<p>For more of Allison Williams, watch <a title=\"girls\" href=\"http://www.hbo.com/girls/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Girls</em></a>&#160;Sundays at 9pm EST on <a title=\"hbo\" href=\"http://www.hbo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HBO</a> and to learn more about Simple, click <a title=\"simple\" href=\"http://www.simpleskincare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo: Getty Images</em></p>\n<p>Follow Carly Cardellino on <a title=\"facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/carly.cardellino\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a title=\"twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/CarlyCardellino\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</p>"}],"blog_author":"Carly Cardellino"}],"publish_date":"2013-02-08T19:35:00.000Z","article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","import_chan_id":null,"partner_related_links_list_article":[],"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","total_rate":"0.00","promo_image_url":null,"version":"1","author_last_name":"Cardellino","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"ccardellino","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","in_this_issue_text":"","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"15075898","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-10-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T19:35:09.000Z","author_id":"37906","contributor_first_name":null,"flow_id":"4","contributor_state":null,"import_type_id":null,"customer_id":null,"contributor_country":null,"origin_site_prefix":"cosmopolitan","import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","import_region_id":null,"origin_site_name":"Cosmopolitan","allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"issue_date":"","canonical_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/hairstyles-beauty/beauty-blog/allison-williams-beauty-routine","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"A new study shows that men who make less than their S.O.s are more likely to take erectile dysfunction meds.","site_id":"2","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com","checked_out_by":null,"rate":"0.00","keywords":"study, female breadwinner, relationships, research, breadwinner, money, career","promo_title":"OMFG: Your Career Affects His Sex Drive","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-02-08T20:29:10.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/celebrity/exclusive/fun-fearless-females-2012-rose-byrne","protected":"0","link_text":"Fun Fearless Females 2012: Rose Byrne"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/advice/tips/random-studies","protected":"0","link_text":"Random Studies That Cracked Us Up"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/sex-love/dating-advice/the-great-female-survey-2011","protected":"0","link_text":"8 Fascinating Facts About Women and Relationships"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/sex-love/dating-advice/who-should-pay-0908","protected":"0","link_text":"Is Splitting the Bill Hurting Your Romance?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/advice/tips/The-New-Life-Rules-to-Follow-Now","protected":"0","link_text":"The New Life Rules to Follow Now"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/cosmo-latina/claudia-duncan-interview","protected":"0","link_text":"Hot Careers You Want: The Fearless Innovator"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/cosmo-latina/career-tips","protected":"0","link_text":"Take Charge of Your Career"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/cosmo-latina/jackie-gomez-interview","protected":"0","link_text":"Hot Careers You Want: The Celebrity Makeup Artist"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/cosmo-latina/how-to-start-event-planning-business","protected":"0","link_text":"Hot Careers You Want: The Event Planner"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","url":"/celebrity/exclusive/fun-fearless-females-2012-zoe-saldana","protected":"0","link_text":"Fun Fearless Females 2012: Zo&euml;

And, in the comments, many of you said that such a situation wouldn't fly in your own lives. <br /><br />\n\nWell, the idea of a female breadwinner is back in the news with the <a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/02/02/0146167212475321.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">release of a new study</a> showing that men whose wives earn more income than they do are more likely to use erectile dysfunction medication than those who outearn their wives&#151;even when the difference between their earnings is small. Researchers also found that breadwinner wives have increased insomnia and anxiety medication usage. Which is pretty crazy, right?<br /><br />\n\nWe're all for a <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/news/women-are-overworked\" target=\"_blank\">high-powered woman</a> bringing home the bacon</a>. But, we can't help but wonder if those prescribed gender roles for men and women are so ingrained within us (and within society) that messing with them messes with our heads&#151;and our relationships. Men, traditionally, are supposed to support the family, so not doing so could put unexpected pressure on a guy's female partner and make him feel emasculated for not living up to the role he \"should\" play in his family. <br /><br />\n\nThat said, this is pretty screwy and if a man can't deal with your success (and appreciate how it benefits both of you), he's got some other issues.\n<br /><br />\nOf course the pill popping could be because guys who earn less just feel pressure to really bring it in bed. In which case, we totally approve. Just maybe...they could do it <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/viagra-recreational-use\" target=\"_blank\">without artificial enhancement</a>.\n<br /><br />\n\n\n\nWant more from Natasha?
